    question: "1.What is n in the formulae?",
    answer:
      "It is the number of person present in a mine where ventilation needs to be provided in a largest shift",
  },
  {
    question: "2.What is a complication of positive pressure ventilation?    ",
    answer:
      "You are moving a lot more air than you need going through the filters, so power requirement increases, and so will the filter capacity. The good thing is you do not have to be very concerned about small leaks, this system will tolerate it to a certain limits.Usually overpressure means just enough pressure over ambient pressure so no external contaminants will enter the ventilated areas. You usually find this system in armored vehicles to protect against NBC attacks, (nuclear, bio, chemical) operating rooms and clean rooms. ",

    question: "3.What is Mine Ventilation?    ",
    answer:
      "Mine Ventilation is the process of supplying sufficient fresh air to the underground and working to achieve this purpose, ensuring proper distribution and use of the air and controlling the return to the surface of contaminated air.",
  },
  {
    question: "4.Why do we use mechanical ventilation ?    ",
    answer:
      "A mechanical ventilation is used to supplying the air where the miner will be breathing well.Remove Dust like noxious gases(NO2,METHANE,CO2 AND CO).Regulated temperature in the hot and deep mines mechanical ventilation is used.Pressure difference is created by operating one or more fans in an airway.Each fan create a certain amount of pressure and that pressure gradually lost as the air passes through the airway against its resistance.",
