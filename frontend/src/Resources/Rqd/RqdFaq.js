    question: "1.What is RQD?",
    answer:
      "RQD stands for Rock Quality Designation and it is a method designed by engineers for geologists to attempt to quantify qualitative information so engineers can do math.",
  },
  {
    question: "2.What is the importance of RQD?",
    answer:
      "Mine. RQD. It has no fundamental constants.Everything derives from Potential Energy which is meaningfully described. ",
  },
  {
    question: "3.Did mining locations depend upon RQD value?",
    answer:
      "The logistic cost of fuel is an important factor for the viability of any industry. Lesser it is better it is. Hence location of Coal mine is an important factor for Industry.Another aspect is logistic constraint. With the lesser availability of railway rakes for transportation of coal, availability of adequate quantity of coal for industrial requirements becomes a herculean task. This aspect also favors for ideal location of Coal mines for an industry requiring coal as fuel. But, quite less dependen upon the RQD.",
